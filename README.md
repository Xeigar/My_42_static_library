# My own static library ðŸ“š
This was the culmination of the first four projects of 42 Porto common core. This static library libft.a has all the functions we were told to do in libft as well as ft_printf and get_next_line.

## How to use ?
In order to use this static library, clone it to a directory. Afterwards type ``make`` and then ``clean``.
Copy "libft.a" and "libft.h" files to the repository where you want to use the functions contained in the static library.

Lastly add to your files, preferentially in the header file ``#include "libft.h"``, and when compiling add "libft.a" after the flags.
